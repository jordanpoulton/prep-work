# Create a method 'random_select' which, when given an array of elements (array) and a number (n), returns n randomly selected elements from that array.

# Example: Given an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and 2 should return two random numbers from the given array. (Note: those two random numbers may be the same number.) The method should return those random values in a new array.

# NB - Calling the method twice should ideally return different sets of values (though it may not).


puts random_select([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) #=> [2,5] *****ANY TWO RANDOM NUMBERS FROM THE ARRAY IN A NEW ARRAY
